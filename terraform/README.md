## Detailed Recommendations

**
*   **Containerization:** **Strongly recommend** creating a `Dockerfile` for the application. This ensures consistent environments and is necessary for ECS deployment. Example `Dockerfile` structure:
*   **Build & Store Image:** Use AWS ECR (Elastic Container Registry) to store the built Docker image. Implement a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild) to automate building and pushing the image to ECR upon code changes (recommendation, not included in Terraform below).
*   **Networking (VPC):** Deploy into a custom VPC spanning at least 3 Availability Zones for high availability.
    *   Use public subnets for the Application Load Balancer (ALB) and NAT Gateways.
    *   Use private subnets for the ECS Fargate tasks and DocumentDB cluster instances to prevent direct internet exposure.
    *   Use an Internet Gateway (IGW) attached to the VPC for internet access from public subnets.
    *   Use NAT Gateways (one per AZ, placed in public subnets) associated with private route tables to allow outbound internet access from private subnets (e.g., for accessing external APIs, package managers) while preventing inbound connections.
*   **Compute (ECS Fargate):** Deploy the containerized application using ECS Fargate.
    *   Define an ECS Cluster.
    *   Create an ECS Task Definition specifying the Docker image (from ECR), CPU/memory resources, IAM roles, logging configuration (CloudWatch Logs), and environment variables/secrets.
    *   Create an ECS Service to maintain the desired number of tasks, distribute them across AZs, and integrate with the ALB.
*   **Load Balancing (ALB):** Use an Application Load Balancer to distribute incoming traffic across the ECS tasks in different AZs.
    *   Configure listeners (e.g., HTTPS on 443, potentially HTTP on 80 redirecting to 443).
    *   Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to provision and manage free SSL/TLS certificates for HTTPS.
    *   Configure health checks to ensure traffic is only sent to healthy tasks.
*   **Database (DocumentDB):** Use AWS DocumentDB as a managed, MongoDB-compatible database.
    *   Deploy a cluster across multiple AZs for HA.
    *   Place cluster instances in the private subnets.
    *   Configure a Security Group allowing access only from the ECS tasks' security group on the required port (default 27017).
*   **Secrets Management:** Use AWS Secrets Manager to securely store and manage database credentials and any other sensitive configuration. Inject these secrets into the ECS task definition instead of hardcoding them or using environment variables directly.
*   **Static Assets (S3/CloudFront):**
    *   Store static files (`public` directory contents: `.html`, `.css`, `.js`, images) in an S3 bucket.
    *   Use CloudFront (CDN) pointing to the S3 bucket (using an Origin Access Identity - OAI - to restrict direct S3 access) to serve these assets globally with low latency and high speed. This offloads work from the application servers.
    *   Configure the application's HTML to reference assets via the CloudFront distribution domain name.
*   **DNS (Route 53):** Use Route 53 to manage the application's domain name. Create Alias records pointing to the ALB and the CloudFront distribution.
*   **Auto Scaling:** Configure Application Auto Scaling for the ECS Service based on metrics like CPU utilization, memory utilization, or request count per target (via ALB metrics).
*   **Security:**
    *   Use Security Groups to enforce the principle of least privilege (e.g., ALB SG allows traffic from the internet on 80/443, ECS SG allows traffic from ALB SG on the app port, DB SG allows traffic from ECS SG on the DB port).
    *   Use IAM roles with minimal necessary permissions for ECS tasks (e.g., access to Secrets Manager, CloudWatch Logs, potentially S3 if needed by the app logic).
    *   Consider enabling AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) on the ALB for protection against common web exploits (SQL injection, XSS).
*   **Monitoring & Logging:**
    *   Configure ECS tasks to send container logs to CloudWatch Logs.
    *   Monitor key metrics (ECS CPU/Memory, ALB request count/latency/errors, DocumentDB CPU/connections/latency) in CloudWatch Metrics.
    *   Set up CloudWatch Alarms based on these metrics to trigger notifications (SNS) or auto-scaling actions.
    *   Create a CloudWatch Dashboard to visualize key operational metrics.
*   **Cost Optimization:** Start with appropriately sized Fargate tasks and DocumentDB instances (e.g., t3.medium). Monitor usage and adjust sizes. Leverage Auto Scaling to match capacity to demand. Consider AWS Savings Plans or Reserved Instances for compute/database resources if usage is predictable over 1 or 3 years. Using Fargate avoids paying for idle EC2 instances. S3/CloudFront is cost-effective for static assets.

## Estimated Monthly Costs

**
*(Note: This is a rough estimate based on common configurations in `us-east-1` and subject to change based on actual usage, region, traffic patterns, and instance sizing. Use the AWS Pricing Calculator for a detailed estimate.)*
*   **Assumptions:**
    *   Region: `us-east-1` (N. Virginia)
    *   AZs: 3
    *   ECS Fargate Tasks: 2 running on average (scales up/down), 1 vCPU / 2 GB RAM each.
    *   DocumentDB: 2 x `db.t3.medium` instances (1 primary, 1 replica for HA), 50 GB storage.
    *   ALB: Processing 500 GB data/month, 10 million requests.
    *   NAT Gateways: 3 Gateways (1 per AZ), processing 50 GB data/month each.
    *   S3: 10 GB Standard storage, moderate PUT/GET requests.
    *   CloudFront: 100 GB data transfer out to the internet.
    *   CloudWatch: 10 GB Logs ingested/stored, standard metrics/alarms.
    *   Route 53: 1 Hosted Zone, standard queries.
    *   Secrets Manager: 1 Secret.
    *   Data Transfer: Assuming moderate inter-AZ and internet traffic.
*   **Estimated Monthly Breakdown:**
    *   **ECS Fargate:** (2 tasks * 1 vCPU * $0.04048/hr + 2 tasks * 2 GB * $0.004445/GB-hr) * 730 hrs/month ≈ $40 - $60
    *   **DocumentDB:** (2 instances * $0.094/hr * 730 hrs/month) + (50 GB * $0.20/GB-month) + I/O costs ≈ $140 - $180 + I/O
    *   **Application Load Balancer:** ($0.0225/hr * 730 hrs/month) + (LCU Hours - estimate ~10 LCU avg) ≈ $17 + $6 = $23 - $40
    *   **NAT Gateways:** (3 * $0.045/hr * 730 hrs/month) + (3 * 50 GB * $0.045/GB processed) ≈ $99 + $7 = $106 - $120
    *   **S3:** (10 GB * $0.023/GB-month) + Request costs ≈ $1 - $5
    *   **CloudFront:** (100 GB * ~$0.085/GB) + Request costs ≈ $9 - $15
    *   **CloudWatch:** Logs + Metrics + Alarms ≈ $10 - $25
    *   **Route 53:** $0.50 (Hosted Zone) + Query costs ≈ $1 - $3
    *   **Secrets Manager:** $0.40 per secret per month ≈ $0.40
    *   **Data Transfer:** (Inter-AZ, Outbound from NAT GW/ALB etc.) Highly variable ≈ $10 - $50+
*   **Total Estimated Monthly Cost:** **$320 - $500+ USD** (Highly dependent on actual load, scaling events, and data transfer volumes. I/O costs for DocumentDB can also vary significantly.)
